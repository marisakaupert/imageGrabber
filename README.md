Tool to grab images in Maya. 

These are what I got from the meeting:
    1. Take an image in Maya without having to do a manual screenshot
    2. Have it be set to a certain resoluton so the image is never skewed
    3. Have the image be saved to a path
    4. The image needs 'tags' so it know where to store the image and upload it on Shotgun
